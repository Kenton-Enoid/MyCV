    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I'm a highly-driven Software Engineer student with growing knowledge in AI and Python language.
            I'm actively seeking an opportunity in the IT industry since I recently acquired skills from Microsoft Azure.
            As a Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamentals,Azure Fundamentals, Azure AI Engineer Associate, 
            Azure Administrator Associate, Azure IoT Developer Specialty and the one I'm mostly passionate about
            which is the DevOps Engineer Expert. I'm ready to contribute my passion and skills to help drive innovation 
            as a global technology leader.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            I like to spend most of my time doing research about this tech industry as it's growing at a rapid pace. My
            interest in Software Engineering came from AI, I've been eager to know how the modern machinery operates and want 
            to be part of history making, having to know that I made someone to be able to work smart using devices created 
            by myself and other developers in the world.
